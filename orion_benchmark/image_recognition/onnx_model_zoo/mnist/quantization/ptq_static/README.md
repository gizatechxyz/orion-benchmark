Step-by-Step
============

This example load an image classification model from [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models) and confirm its accuracy and speed based on MNIST dataset.

# Prerequisite

## 1. Environment
```shell
pip install neural-compressor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Note: Validated ONNX Runtime [Version](/docs/source/installation_guide.md#validated-software-environment).

## 2. Prepare Model
Download model from [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models)

```shell
wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/classification/mnist/model/mnist-12.onnx
```

# Run

## 1. Quantization

```bash
bash run_tuning.sh --input_model=path/to/model \  # model path as *.onnx
                   --dataset_location=/path/to/mnist \ # if dataset doesn't exist, it will be downloaded automatically into this path
                   --output_model=path/to/save
```

## 2. Benchmark

```bash
bash run_benchmark.sh --input_model=path/to/model \  # model path as *.onnx
                      --dataset_location=/path/to/mnist \ # if dataset doesn't exist, it will be downloaded automatically into this path
                      --mode=performance # or accuracy
```
